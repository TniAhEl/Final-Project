# Internship Final Project 

This project is a fullstack e-commerce web application developed using Java Spring Boot for the backend and ReactJS with Vite for the frontend. The platform allows users to browse and filter available products by category, brand, price, and specifications. Users can register and log in to manage their personal accounts, add products to their cart, and place orders in a simple, user-friendly interface.

The system supports two main roles: Customer and Admin. Customers can manage their orders and receive automated email notifications for order placement and confirmation. The admin has full control over the system, including product management, order processing, warranty and insurance management, and user monitoring.

Authentication and authorization are implemented using JWT for secure API access. Emails are sent using JavaMailSender, providing real-time notifications during key actions such as order placement, and order confirmation.
